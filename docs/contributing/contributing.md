## How to add a new format?

Here is a [good example commit](https://github.com/marph91/jimmy/commit/362acf0319b130c5abb90324129b76c1b5ebefca).

The brief workflow is:

1. Discuss the format at the forum or GitHub
2. Implement at [src/](https://github.com/marph91/jimmy/tree/master/src/formats)
3. Provide an example file and [add a test](https://github.com/marph91/jimmy/blob/master/test/example_commands.sh)
4. Lint with [lint.sh](https://github.com/marph91/jimmy/blob/master/lint.sh)
5. Document at [docs/](https://github.com/marph91/jimmy/tree/master/docs/formats)
