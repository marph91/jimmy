# Import Instructions

This page describes how you can import the notes that you just converted to Markdown.

## Any Editor

Open the root folder in the editor.

## Joplin

Markdown files can be imported to Joplin as described [on the website](https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/import_export/#importing-from-markdown-files):

1. In Joplin, go to `File -> Import` and choose:
    - `MD - Markdown (Directory)` if you converted without front matter. This is the default.
    - `MD - Markdown + Front Matter (Directory)` if you converted with front matter. You can add front matter by using the `--frontmatter joplin` argument.
2. Select the root folder.

## Logseq

Since Logseq doesn't support folders, this will only work with "flat exports". I. e. where all Markdown files are in the root folder. It works for example with [Google Keep](formats/google_keep.md).

1. Use the arguments `--output-folder "pages" --global-resource-folder "../assets"`. This exports the Markdown notes to the `pages` folder and the resources next to it in a `assets` folder. Just like it is in Logseq. A complete command could look like `jimmy-cli-linux takeout-20240401T160516Z-001.zip --format google_keep --output-folder "pages" --global-resource-folder "../assets"`
2. Either copy the folders to your Logseq graph or open them as new graph to check how it looks.

## Obsidian

Markdown files can be imported to Obsidian as described [on the website](https://help.obsidian.md/import/markdown):

- Copy the root folder to you vault or open it as a new vault.
- Add metadata in the front matter by using the `--frontmatter obsidian` argument.

## QOwnNotes

1. Use the arguments `--local-resource-folder attachments --local-image-folder media`. This is not required, but aligns with the internal structure of QOwnNotes.
2. Copy the root folder to your note folder or open it as a new note folder.
3. If you have subfolders, enable `Note -> Settings -> Use note subfolders`.
4. If you want to convert tags:
    1. Use the argument `--frontmatter qownnotes`
    2. Detect the front matter tags by installing the [epsilon-notes-tags](https://github.com/qownnotes/scripts/tree/master/epsilon-notes-tags) or [yaml-nested-tags](https://github.com/qownnotes/scripts/tree/master/yaml-nested-tags) plugin.

A complete command could look like `jimmy-cli-linux takeout.zip --format google_keep --frontmatter qownnotes --local-resource-folder attachments --local-image-folder media`.

## Notion

Markdown files can be imported to Notion as described [on the website](https://www.notion.so/help/import-data-into-notion). This will only import Markdown notes, though. Importing resources seems to be not supported.

## UpNote

Import from Markdown will most likely work as described [on the website](https://help.getupnote.com/import-export-share-and-print/import-content-to-upnote/import-from-markdown). The feature is behind a paywall, so I couldn't test it. Be aware that export to Markdown is behind a paywall, too!

## VNote

Choose "Import Folder" as described in the [documentation](https://vnote.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/en_us/docs/Users/Notes%20Management.html?#import-files-and-folders).
